- Exercise 1:
  - Normalize, identify, and enumerate each of the attributes / variables in the "Web_access_log-akumenius.com" file structure found in the GitHub repository "Data-sources".

### Level 2

- Exercise 2:
  - Cleans, preprocesses, structures and transforms (dataframe) the data of the Web Access record.
- Exercise 3:
  - Geolocates IP's. Here is a page of interest:

### Level 3

- Exercise 4:
